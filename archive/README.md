# Archive

This directory contains archived files that are not actively used in the main codebase.

## Structure

- **Root level** - Debug scripts, test utilities, one-off scripts
- **docs/** - Old documentation files (superseded by main README.md, START_HERE.md, etc.)

## Note

These files are kept for reference but are not part of the active development workflow.
